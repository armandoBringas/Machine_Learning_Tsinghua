    abstract = {Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (F1-score > 93.31%), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (r=.60). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

    abstract  = {This research introduces a novel high-accuracy time-series forecasting method, namely the Time Neural Network (TNN), which is based on a kernel filter and time attention mechanism. Taking into account the complex characteristics of time-series data, such as non-linearity, high dimensionality, and long-term dependence, the TNN model is designed and implemented. The key innovations of the TNN model lie in the incorporation of the time attention mechanism and kernel filter, allowing the model to allocate different weights to features at each time point, and extract high-level features from the time-series data, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, an adaptive weight generator is integrated into the model, enabling the model to automatically adjust weights based on input features. Mainstream time-series forecasting models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) are employed as baseline models and comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted. The results indicate that the TNN model significantly outperforms the baseline models in both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. Specifically, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 reach 0.05, 0.23, and 0.95, respectively. Remarkably, even for complex time-series data that contain a large amount of noise, the TNN model still maintains a high prediction accuracy.},

    abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to report on the accuracy of estimating sleep stages using a wrist-worn device that measures movement using a 3D accelerometer and an optical pulse photoplethysmograph (PPG). Approach: Overnight recordings were obtained from 60 adult participants wearing these devices on their left and right wrist, simultaneously with a Type III home sleep testing device (Embletta MPR) which included EEG channels for sleep staging. The 60 participants were self-reported normal sleepers (36 M: 24 F, age  =  34  ±  10, BMI  =  28  ±  6). The Embletta recordings were scored for sleep stages using AASM guidelines and were used to develop and validate an automated sleep stage estimation algorithm, which labeled sleep stages as one of Wake, Light (N1 or N2), Deep (N3) and REM (REM). Features were extracted from the accelerometer and PPG sensors, which reflected movement, breathing and heart rate variability. Main results: Based on leave-one-out validation, the overall per-epoch accuracy of the automated algorithm was 69%, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.52  ±  0.14. There was no observable bias to under- or over-estimate wake, light, or deep sleep durations. REM sleep duration was slightly over-estimated by the system. The most common misclassifications were light/REM and light/wake mislabeling. Significance: The results indicate that a reasonable degree of sleep staging accuracy can be achieved using a wrist-worn device, which may be of utility in longitudinal studies of sleep habits.}

Input data is structured as a time-series sequence of mentioned signals that represent 30 seconds epoch, which is a standard interval for sleep analysis. The records used belong to the overall 23 subjects, which are divided into two subsets. Records from 18 subjects were used for training the data and from 5 subjects for testing the data. For detecting four sleep stages: REM (Rapid Eye Movement), Wake, Light sleep (Stage 1 and Stage 2), and Deep sleep (Stage 3 and Stage 4), the accuracy of the model is 55%, and F1 score is 44%. For five stages: REM, Stage 1, Stage 2, Deep sleep (Stage 3 and 4), and Wake, the model gives an accuracy of 40% and F1 score of 37%.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
The classification of sleep stages is a preliminary exam that contributes to the diagnosis of possible sleep disorders. However, it is a tedious and time-consuming task when conducted manually by experts. Many studies explored ways of automating polysomnogram signals analysis. They are based on two main strategies: conventional machine learning and deep learning methods. The objective of this work is to carry out a comparative study on these two classes of models.
Method
A primary comparison of performance of these classifiers is carried out using eight conventional machine learning algorithms and a feed-forward neural networks to assess whether this latter method have definitely supplanted the first. As sleep epochs show inter-epochs correlation, a study of the distinctive influence of this temporal dependence on the classifiers performance is then conducted introducing for this purpose (uni- and bi-directional) long short-term memory networks. In a context of generalization of the use of wearable devices, a comparison of the classification methods examined is also carried out in their accuracy when dealing with a reduced number of channels. Finally, the robustness of the results obtained to the choice of features selection algorithms is discussed.
Results and conclusion
Our results show that support vector machine with radial basis function and random forest are just as valid for predicting sleep stages classification as feature-based neural networks with performance closed to the state of the art. This conclusion remains valid even after the introduction of inter-epochs temporal dependence, reduction of the number of channels or change in features selection method.}

Excessive sleep arousals are associated with symptoms such as sympathetic activation, non-restorative sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Currently, sleep arousals are mainly annotated by human experts through looking at 30-second epochs (recorded pages) manually, which requires considerable time and effort. Here we present a deep learning approach for automatically segmenting sleep arousal regions based on polysomnographic recordings. Leveraging a specific architecture that ‘translates’ input polysomnographic signals to sleep arousal labels, this algorithm ranked first in the “You Snooze, You Win” PhysioNet Challenge. We created an augmentation strategy by randomly swapping similar physiological channels, which notably improved the prediction accuracy. Our algorithm enables fast and accurate delineation of sleep arousal events at the speed of 10 seconds per sleep recording. This computational tool would greatly empower the scoring process in clinical settings and accelerate studies on the impact of arousals.},

    abstract = {Automated evaluation of a subject's neurocognitive performance (NCP) is a relevant topic in neurological and clinical studies. NCP represents the mental/cognitive human capacity in performing a specific task. It is difficult to develop the study protocols as the subject's NCP changes in a known predictable way. Sleep is time-varying NCP and can be used to develop novel NCP techniques. Accurate analysis and interpretation of human sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is needed for proper NCP assessment. In addition, sleep deprivation may cause prominent cognitive risks in performing many common activities such as driving or controlling a generic device; therefore, sleep scoring is a crucial part of the process. In the sleep cycle, the first stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or stage N1 is the transition between wakefulness and drowsiness and becomes relevant for the study of NCP. In this study, a novel cascaded recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks, is proposed for the automated scoring of sleep stages using EEG signals derived from a single-channel. Fifty-five time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the EEG signals and fed to feature reduction algorithms to select the most relevant ones. The selected features constituted as the inputs to the LSTM networks. The cascaded architecture is composed of two LSTM RNNs: the first network performed 4-class classification (i.e. the five sleep stages with the merging of stages N1 and REM into a single stage) with a classification rate of 90.8%, and the second one obtained a recognition performance of 83.6% for 2-class classification (i.e. N1 vs REM). The overall percentage of correct classification for five sleep stages is found to be 86.7%. The objective of this work is to improve classification performance in sleep stage N1, as a first step of NCP assessment, and at the same time obtain satisfactory classification results in the other sleep stages.}

abstract = {In this paper, a study is conducted to investigate the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning system in automatic sleep stage scoring. The developed algorithm will automatically learn to classify sleep stages from any acquired sleep signals data-set. This allows to resolve the difficulties that are facing experts in manual sleep stage scoring. A total of 39 Polysomnogram (PSG) recordings acquired from the online PhysioNet Sleep-EDF database are used in this study. The PSG recordings are chosen to be from the EEG Fpz-Cz signals only. The database comes with annotation files that include expert manual stage scoring based on the Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) scoring manual. The obtained signals go initially through a pre-processing procedure where sleep stages signals are extracted, normalized, and filtered. The resulting sleep signals are trained using a k-fold cross-validation scheme of 10-folds. Prior to the training and classification process, the LSTM network architecture is built using Uni- and Bi-directional structures to utilize both the forward and backward chains of data sequences. At the end, the developed algorithm performance is evaluated and a complete performance summary table is provided relative to other State-of-the-Art deep learning studies. The performance of this study is evaluated initially without the merging of S3 and S4 sleep stages following the R&K manual, which is considered challenging due to the minor differences between the signals. Then, the performance is evaluated following the recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring manual with the merging of the two stages as N3. The developed algorithm achieved higher results using the Bi-directional LSTM. In addition, it achieved the highest accuracy among all other studies in the field with 97.28%. Furthermore, Cohen's kappa and F1-score were more than 72% on average between all sleep stages. According to the confusion matrix, the algorithm successfully classified sleep signals with an overall True Positives percentage of 91.92%. The performance of the algorithm improved following the AASM manual, where the Cohen's kappa value increased from 72.55% to 77.73%. The developed algorithm showed potential in automatic sleep stage classification. Future works include further enhancements on the LSTM algorithm to achieve higher levels of performance.}

Clinical sleep scoring involves a tedious visual review of overnight polysomnograms by a human expert, according to official standards. It could appear then a suitable task for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Indeed, machine learning algorithms have been applied to sleep scoring for many years. As a result, several software products offer nowadays automated or semi-automated scoring services. However, the vast majority of the sleep physicians do not use them. Very recently, thanks to the increased computational power, deep learning has also been employed with promising results. Machine learning algorithms can undoubtedly reach a high accuracy in specific situations, but there are many difficulties in their introduction in the daily routine. In this review, the latest approaches that are applying deep learning for facilitating and accelerating sleep scoring are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the state of the art methods. Then the obstacles in introducing automated sleep scoring in the clinical practice are examined. Deep learning algorithm capabilities of learning from a highly heterogeneous dataset, in terms both of human data and of scorers, are very promising and should be further investigated.}
